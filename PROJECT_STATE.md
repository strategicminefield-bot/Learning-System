# Learning System — Project State

## Purpose

The Learning System is a persistent, VPS-hosted Learning Fabric intended to become the permanent source of truth for multiple AI assistants and AI workers.

The AI assistants are clients/workers of the system. The system itself must retain project state, task state, results, observations, history and learning independently of any particular AI conversation.

The long-term objective is for ChatGPT, Claude, OpenClaw and other AI systems to be able to work on the same projects without losing momentum when one AI becomes unavailable.

---

## Core Architecture

Current intended architecture:

- WSL/laptop = development and deployment interface
- GitHub = authoritative source for executable code
- VPS = 24/7 production/runtime environment
- PostgreSQL on VPS = authoritative persistent state/history
- Learning Fabric API = interface between AI nodes/workers and persistent state
- AI assistants/nodes = workers/controllers/clients
- Future layers include:
  - vector memory
  - knowledge graph
  - event/history
  - tasks/messages
  - learning
  - orchestration
  - API

The AI conversation itself must NOT be the sole source of project memory.

## Repository

GitHub repository:

`strategicminefield-bot/Learning-System`

Local WSL working directory:

`~/Learning-System`

VPS:

`vultr`

VPS application directory:

`/opt/learning-fabric`

API container:

`learning-fabric-api`

---

## Development Rule

Use this development cycle:

1. Develop a substantial coherent batch in WSL.
2. Test the complete batch.
3. Commit the completed batch.
4. Push to GitHub.
5. Deploy the batch to the VPS.
6. Run an end-to-end VPS verification.
7. Clean temporary development files.
8. Start the next substantial batch.

Do NOT unnecessarily split development into tiny endpoint-by-endpoint cycles.

GitHub remains the source of truth.

## Current Section

SECTION 2 — Worker / Assignment Lifecycle

Objective:

Create the complete lifecycle allowing an AI worker/node to receive work, claim it, execute attempts, record results and observations, and complete or fail the assignment.

Required lifecycle:

assignment
→ claim
→ attempt
→ result
→ observations
→ complete/fail
→ task/node state updates

---

## Database

PostgreSQL is already available on the VPS.

Foundation migration:

`migrations/001_foundation.sql`

Learning Fabric core migration:

`migrations/002_learning_fabric_core.sql`

Important tables include:

- workflows
- tasks
- task_dependencies
- assignments
- attempts
- results
- observations
- nodes
- requests
- events

Important status values currently used:

### Assignment

- assigned
- claimed
- completed
- failed

### Task

- pending
- running
- completed
- failed

### Attempt

- running
- completed
- failed

### Node

- available
- busy

---

## Section 2 Completed

### Assignment creation

Existing endpoint:

`POST /assignments`

Creates an assignment for a task/node.

### Assignment claim

Endpoint:

`POST /assignments/{assignment_id}/claim`

Behaviour:

- validates assignment
- validates node
- requires assignment status `assigned`
- changes assignment to `claimed`
- records `claimed_at`
- changes task to `running`
- records task `started_at` if not already set
- changes node to `busy`

This has been tested successfully on the live VPS.

### Attempt creation

Endpoint:

`POST /assignments/{assignment_id}/attempts`

Behaviour:

- validates assignment
- validates node
- requires assignment status `claimed`
- creates an attempt
- increments assignment attempt count
- starts attempt with status `running`

This has been tested successfully on the live VPS.

## Current Live Test Data

Clean worker lifecycle test:

Node:

`cea1feee-950d-4eeb-a586-cec64428ebf2`

Assignment:

`fb006371-b5ba-41ce-bf29-42762653daba`

Task:

`c78148e7-434b-44ff-a8ef-ff006075aaa3`

Latest test attempt:

`f0637df0-acf8-45ff-8373-b7ba0ebe7dc1`

Latest attempt number:

`1`

Latest attempt status:

`running`

The test assignment/task/node are currently part of the live test state.

---

## Git History

Important completed commits:

`1b50bae` — Add assignment claim lifecycle

`d3a40fe` — Add task attempt lifecycle

Both were pushed successfully to GitHub.

---

## Current Code

API:

`fabric/api/main.py`

Worker/orchestration API:

`fabric/api/orchestration.py`

Current orchestration API includes:

- workflow creation
- task creation
- task dependency creation
- assignment creation
- assignment claim
- attempt creation

---

## Deployment

API deployment script:

`scripts/deploy-api.sh`

Normal deployment command:

```bash
cd ~/Learning-System && ./scripts/deploy-api.sh
